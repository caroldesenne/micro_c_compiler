    "The goal of this task is to write a complete compiler for uC (micro C) Language, designed exclusively for this purpose. uC has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. We chose the Python programming language for this task because it has clear and direct syntax and allows for rapid prototyping. In addition, we will have at our disposal a wonderful combination of tools and code in Python that make compilers so cool."

    "Once syntax trees are built, additional analysis and synthesis can be done by evaluating attributes and executing code fragments on tree nodes. We can also walk through the AST to generate a linear N-address code, delineated through basic blocks, analogously to LLVM IR. We call this intermediate machine code as uCIR. So, in this second project, you will perform semantic checks on your program, and turn the AST into uCIR. uCIR uses Single Static Assignment (SSA), and can promote stack allocated scalars to virtual registers and remove the load and store operations, allowing better optimizations since values propagate directly to their use sites.  The main thing that distinguishes SSA from a conventional three-address code is that all assignments in SSA are for distinguished name variables. Details about this project are in the [Second Project](./SecondProject.ipynb) notebook."

You're going to build a control flow graph (CFG) and compute the SSA graph, reflected through phi operations in the uCIR. Next, you're going to compute the dominators for the CFG, i.e. for each basic block, identify the set of basic blocks that dominate that block. This means that every path from the entry block to that block must go through the blocks in the dominator set. After that, you can simplify control flow (1) by merging consecutive blocks where the parent has one child, the child one parent, and both have compatible instruction leaders; (2) find all immediate dead blocks and remove then and finally, perform some basic optimizations like constant propagation and dead code elimination.\n",

LLVM is a set of production-quality reusable libraries for building compilers. LLVM separates computer architectures from language issues and simplifies the design and portability of new compilers. Before you start, carefully study this simplified specification of the LLVM-IR, tailored to our needs, to familiarize yourself with data structures, addressing modes, and the instructions. The full LLVM IR specification you can find [here](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html).\n",

    "The programming projects in this course implement stages of the compilation process and, consequently, each task is based on the previous one. This means that if you start to fall behind in one of the tasks, it can be extremely difficult to get back on track again. That said, I fully understand that you may need extra time to complete each of the tasks. In that sense, you have five days overdue on the calendar that can be used in any of the assignments without penalty. I appreciate a warning so that I can expect your solution late. However, after using all five days late, your assignments will be penalized by 10% per day late; so try to deliver them on time! For logistical reasons, there are no permitted delays in delivering the final programming stage (fourth project)."
